🚀 **Build your own private VPN network — without SaaS lock-in or painful configurations.**

**NovusGate** is a modern, fully self-hosted **VPN control plane** built on top of the **WireGuard®** protocol.  
It allows you to securely connect servers, cloud instances, and personal devices using a clean **Hub-and-Spoke architecture**, all managed from a single web dashboard.

Whether you're running production infrastructure or simply want full ownership of your private network, **NovusGate gives you clarity, security, and control**.

## ⚠️ Important: What NovusGate Is (and Isn't)

**NovusGate is NOT a "hide my IP" or "bypass geo-restrictions" VPN.**

It is a **private network infrastructure tool** designed for:
- ✅ Secure server-to-server communication
- ✅ Remote access to internal services
- ✅ Connecting distributed infrastructure
- ✅ Building trusted private networks

**Traffic Routing:**
- Only traffic destined for your VPN subnets (e.g., `10.x.x.x`) goes through the tunnel
- Your regular internet traffic (YouTube, Google, etc.) goes directly through your ISP
- This is called **Split Tunneling** — efficient and purposeful

If you need a "full tunnel" VPN to hide all your traffic, NovusGate is not the right tool. Use commercial VPN services for that purpose.

---

## 🎯 The Problem NovusGate Solves

**Scenario:** You have a server somewhere (cloud, home, office) but:
- ❌ You don't have a static IP to connect to it
- ❌ You don't want to expose your server's IP directly to the internet
- ❌ NAT/Firewall makes direct connections impossible

**Solution with NovusGate:**

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Server   │     │  NovusGate Hub  │     │  Your Computer  │
│   (No Static IP)│     │   (Cloud VPS)   │     │  (Home/Office)  │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│   10.10.10.2    │────▶│   10.10.10.1    │◀────│   10.10.10.3    │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
         │                     ▲                     │
         └────────── Both connect to Hub ──────────┘
```

Once both devices connect to NovusGate:
- ✅ They see each other as if on the **same local network**
- ✅ Your server becomes `10.10.10.2` — always reachable
- ✅ Your computer becomes `10.10.10.3` — can SSH, RDP, or access any service
- ✅ No port forwarding needed
- ✅ No static IP required
- ✅ Works behind NAT, firewalls, anywhere

**Real-world example:**
```bash
# From your computer (10.10.10.3), connect to your server:
ssh user@10.10.10.2

# Access a web service running on your server:
curl http://10.10.10.2:8080
```

It's like having all your devices on the same LAN — no matter where they physically are.

## ✨ Why NovusGate?

Most private network solutions today are either:
- ❌ SaaS-based black boxes  
- ❌ Hard to manage at scale  
- ❌ Overkill for small teams  
- ❌ Or painful to self-host  

**NovusGate was built to be different.**

It focuses on:
- **Ownership over convenience**
- **Simplicity over complexity**
- **Transparency over abstraction**

You run it.  
You control it.  
Your network — your rules.

## 📡 VPN Type

**NovusGate is a Remote Access VPN with Client-Based Architecture.**

| VPN Type | NovusGate? | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| ☁️ Cloud VPN | ⚠️ | Not a managed service like AWS/Azure VPN Gateway. NovusGate is self-hosted and can run on any cloud or on-premises |
| 🔐 IPsec VPN | ❌ | Uses WireGuard protocol instead of IPsec |
| 🌐 SSL VPN | ❌ | Not browser-based, requires WireGuard client |
| 💻 **Client-Based VPN** | ✅ | Requires WireGuard client software |
| 🏢 Site-to-Site VPN | ⚠️ | Possible via node-to-node connections |
| 📡 **Remote Access VPN** | ✅ | Primary use case |

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Protocol:** WireGuard (modern, fast, secure)
- **Architecture:** Hub-and-Spoke (centralized control)
- **Tunneling:** Encrypted trusted tunnel with Split Tunneling
- **Deployment:** Cloud-ready (any provider) or on-premises
- **Clients:** Mobile (QR), Desktop (.conf), Linux (scripts)

---

## 👥 Who is NovusGate for?

- **SysAdmins** managing secure access between servers and data centers  
- **DevOps Engineers** connecting infrastructure across environments  
- **Developers** building internal or self-hosted platforms  
- **Privacy-conscious users** who want full control over their VPN setup  

If you value **self-hosting, security, and simplicity**, NovusGate is for you.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. A **central server** acts as the control plane  
2. Create **isolated networks** with unique subnets (10.x.x.0/24)
3. Devices register and authenticate securely  
4. WireGuard tunnels are established automatically  
5. Traffic is routed securely through the control plane  

No hidden magic.  
No vendor lock-in.  
Just clean networking.

---

## 📂 System Architecture

NovusGate is designed as a **modular system**, separating control, interface, and deployment for maximum flexibility and maintainability.

## 🌐 Network Management

NovusGate supports **multiple isolated networks**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Isolated Subnets** | Each network has its own CIDR (e.g., 10.10.0.0/24, 10.20.0.0/24) |
| **Dedicated Interfaces** | Automatic WireGuard interface allocation (wg0, wg1, wg2...) |
| **Unique Ports** | Each network listens on a different UDP port (51820, 51821...) |
| **Independent Nodes** | Nodes belong to specific networks and are isolated from others |

### Creating a Network

1. Go to **Networks** page in the dashboard
2. Click **Create Network**
3. Enter a name and CIDR range (e.g., `10.50.0.0/24`)
4. The system automatically assigns interface and port

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

* Installer generates **unique credentials** — save them immediately
* Ensure UDP ports **51820+** are open (one per network)
* Admin dashboard is **hidden behind VPN** by default
* For production use, run the Web Dashboard behind **Nginx or Caddy with SSL**
* **Fail2Ban** is automatically installed and configured to protect SSH (3 failed attempts = 1 hour ban)

Security is not optional — it's the default.

---

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CPU Usage** | Real-time processor utilization percentage |
| **RAM Usage** | Memory consumption with used/total display |
| **Disk Usage** | Storage utilization for the root partition |
| **Uptime** | Server running time since last boot |

All metrics are displayed on the main Dashboard and refresh automatically.

---

## 🔒 Fail2Ban Management

Protect your server from brute-force attacks:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Jail Status** | View active jails (SSH, etc.) and their configuration |
| **Banned IPs** | See currently banned IP addresses per jail |
| **Ban Statistics** | Total bans, current bans, failed attempts |
| **One-Click Unban** | Instantly unban IP addresses from the web interface |
| **Log Viewer** | Browse Fail2Ban logs with action filtering |

Access via **Security → Fail2Ban** in the dashboard.

---

## 🔥 Firewall Management

NovusGate includes a comprehensive firewall management system:

### Host Firewall (iptables)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Open Ports** | View and manage open ports on the server |
| **Block IPs** | Block specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges |
| **Allow IPs** | Whitelist trusted IP addresses |
| **Chain Management** | View INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD chain rules |
| **Protected Ports** | SSH, WireGuard, and API ports are protected from accidental closure |
| **Export Rules** | Download current firewall rules for backup |
| **Reset Firewall** | Restore default NovusGate firewall configuration |

### VPN Firewall (Inter-Network Rules)

Control traffic flow between VPN networks:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Network-to-Network Rules** | Allow or block traffic between different VPN networks |
| **Node-Specific Rules** | Create rules for specific nodes |
| **Protocol Filtering** | Filter by TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all protocols |
| **Port-Based Rules** | Allow/block specific ports or port ranges |
| **Priority System** | Rules are processed in priority order (lower = higher priority) |
| **Auto AllowedIPs** | Client configs automatically include permitted destination networks |

**How VPN Firewall Works:**
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Source Node │ ──► │   VPN Server    │ ──► │ Dest Node   │
│ (10.10.0.2) │     │ FORWARD chain   │     │ (10.20.0.5) │
└─────────────┘     │ VPN Rules apply │     └─────────────┘
                    └─────────────────┘
```

All VPN traffic flows through the server. VPN firewall rules control the server's FORWARD chain, determining which traffic can be forwarded between networks.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Allow office network (10.10.0.0/24) to access admin panel (10.99.0.1)
- Block development network from accessing production servers
- Allow only HTTP/HTTPS traffic between specific networks
- Isolate guest network from internal resources

Access via **Firewall** page in the dashboard.
